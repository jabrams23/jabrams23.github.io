## Bio
I am a Bahamian researcher located in Vancouver, BC on unceeded xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) territory. I’m currently the data products steward for the Pacific Data Stewardship Unit (DSU) at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. As data products steward, I build data pipelines that ensure  access to important ecological datasets. 

I completed an MSc in Biology under the supervision of [Dr. Erin Bertrand](https://erinbertrand.wixsite.com/bertrandlab). At the Bertrand lab, my research area was marine microbial ecophysiology (the study of how organisms react to environmental change). I used meta-omic analyses and bioinformatic pipelines to understand how trace nurtient and temperature dynamics impact microbial function. 



I mantain [the Employment Equity](https://employment-equity.github.io/) site, which hosts analyses and visualizations for disproportionalities in pay based on race across the Canadian Public Service from data [publicly available here](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/human-resources-statistics/diversity-inclusion-statistics.html) through Canada's Treasury Board.  

When I’m not writing up a script, you can often find me cycling, cooking, or teaching. I’m passionate about getting young people excited about science and providing access to information, tools, and skills that spark scientific creativity.

**Interests:** Marine Ecology, Science Communication, Equity and Inclusivity, Climate Justice, Scientific Computing 


## Inquiries
If you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, feel free to [contact me](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca). I am always interested in discussing data science consulting or workshop offerings. 

## Mentorship
I am open to acting as a mentor to youth navigating a career in science when I have the capacity. If you are part of a group which has historically been excluded from STEM and are seeking a mentor, please [reach out via email](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca) with a short introduction about yourself.
